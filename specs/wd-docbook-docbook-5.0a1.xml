<para>DocBook is general purpose <xref linkend="xml-rec"/> schema
particularly well suited to books and papers about computer hardware
and software (though it is by no means limited to these applications).
</para>
<para>The Version 5.0 release is a complete rewrite of DocBook in
RELAX NG. The intent of this rewrite is to produce a schema that is
true to the spirit of DocBook while simultaneously removing
inconsistencies that have arisen as a natural consequence of DocBook's
long, slow evolution. The Technical Committee has taken this
opportunity to simplify a number of content models and tighten
constraints where RELAX NG makes that possible.
</para>
<para>The Technical Committee provides the DocBook 5.0 schema in other
schema languages, including W3C XML Schema and an
XML DTD, but the RELAX NG Schema is now the normative schema.</para>

<title>Introduction</title>

<para>DocBook is general purpose XML schema
particularly well suited to books and papers about computer hardware
and software (though it is by no means limited to these applications).
</para>

<para>The <ulink url="mailto:docbook-tc@oasis-open.org">DocBook
Technical Committee</ulink> maintains the DocBook schema. Starting
with V5.0, DocBook is normatively available as a <xref
linkend="relaxng"/> Schema. W3C XML Schema and Document Type
Definition (DTD) versions are also available.
</para>

<para>The Version 5.0 release is a complete rewrite. In
programming-language terms, think of it as a code refactoring.</para>

<para>This rewrite introduces a large number of backwards-incompatible
changes. Essentially all DocBook V4.x documents will have to be
modified to validate against DocBook V5.0. An XSLT 1.0 stylesheet is
provided to ease this transition.</para>

<para>The DocBook Technical Committee welcomes bug reports and
requests for enhancement (RFEs) from the user community. The current list
of outstanding requests is available through the
<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</ulink>
<ulink url="&tracker;/?atid=384107&amp;group_id=21935&amp;func=browse">tracker</ulink>
interface. This is also the preferred mechanism for submitting new requests.
Old RFEs, from a previous legacy tracking system, are

<title>Changes in DocBook V5.0</title>

<para>In V5.0, DocBook has been rewritten as a native RELAX NG
grammar. The goals of this redesign were to produce a schema
that:</para>

<para>“feels like” DocBook. Most existing documents should still be
valid or it should be possible to transform them in simple, mechanical
ways into valid documents.

<para>enforces as many constraints as possible in the schema. Some additional
constraints are expressed with Schematron rules.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>cleans up the content models.

</orderedlist>

<para>Under the ordinary operating rules of DocBook evolution, the
only backwards incompatible changes that could be made in DocBook V5.0
were those announced in DocBook V4.0. In light of the fact that this
is a complete rewrite, the Technical Committee gave itself the freedom
to make <quote>unannounced</quote> backwards-incompatible changes for
this one release.</para>

<section>
<title>Removing Legacy Elements</title>

<para>A number of elements have been removed from DocBook. Many of
these have been replaced by simpler, more versatile alternatives.
Others have simply been removed because they are not believed to be
widely used.</para>

<section>
<title>Smaller Content Models</title>

<para>The content models of many inlines have been reduced, sometimes
drastically. The parameter entity customization of DocBook V4.x and
previous versions resulted in very broad content models for some
inlines.</para>

<para>Consider, for example,
<sgmltag>command</sgmltag> in DocBook V4.4:</para>

<programlisting>command ::=
   (#PCDATA|link|olink|ulink|action|application|classname|methodname|
   interfacename|exceptionname|ooclass|oointerface|ooexception|
   command|computeroutput|database|email|envar|errorcode|errorname|
   errortype|errortext|filename|function|guibutton|guiicon|guilabel|
   guimenu|guimenuitem|guisubmenu|hardware|interface|keycap|keycode|
   keycombo|keysym|literal|code|constant|markup|medialabel|
   menuchoice|mousebutton|option|optional|parameter|prompt|property|
   replaceable|returnvalue|sgmltag|structfield|structname|symbol|
   systemitem|uri|token|type|userinput|varname|nonterminal|anchor|
   remark|subscript|superscript|inlinegraphic|inlinemediaobject|
   indexterm|beginpage)*</programlisting>

<para>In DocBook V5.0, <sgmltag>command</sgmltag> has a much smaller, more
rational content model:</para>

<programlisting>command ::=

  * Zero or more of:
      o <emphasis>text</emphasis>
      o alt
      o anchor
      o annotation
      o biblioref
      o indexterm
      o inlinemediaobject
      o link
      o phrase
      o remark
      o replaceable
      o subscript
      o superscript
      o xref</programlisting>

<para>DocBook V5.0 may be overzealous in its simplification of content
models. The Technical Committee expects to adjust these simplifications
during user testing. Users are encouraged to report places where formally
valid documents can no longer be made valid because content models have
been reduced.</para>
</section>

<section id="s.unif.info">
<title>Uniform Info Elements</title>

<para>DocBook V4.x has <sgmltag>setinfo</sgmltag>,
<sgmltag>bookinfo</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>chapterinfo</sgmltag>,
<sgmltag>appendixinfo</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>sectioninfo</sgmltag>, etc.
DocBook would be smaller and simpler if it had a single
<sgmltag>info</sgmltag> element in all these places.</para>

<para>There’s an historical reason for the large number of unique
names: customizers might very well want to adjust the content models
of info elements at different levels. For example, a copyright
statement might be required at the book level, or an an author
forbidden at the sub-section level. In DTDs, there’s only one content
model allowed per element name, so in order to support independent
customization, each info element must have a different name.</para>

<para>In RELAX NG, no such limitation exists. We can use patterns to
achieve both a single <sgmltag>info</sgmltag> element while still allowing
customizers to change its content model in different contexts. In light
of this functionality, we've replaced all the various flavors of info
with a single element name.</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Required Titles</title>

<para>DocBook V5.0 enforces the constraint that titles are required on
<sgmltag>article</sgmltag>s and other large structures where they are
effectively optional in DocBook V4.x. (They are optional only in the sense
that DTDs are unable to enforce the constraint that they be present, the
documentation has always made it clear that titles were required.)</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Required Version</title>

<para>In DocBook V4.x and earlier, the presence of a document type declaration
served as a mechanism for identifying the DocBook version of a document.
Although the declaration was not actually required, it was present in the
vast majority of DocBook documents.</para>

<para>In RELAX NG, no similar declaration exists. Although a document type
declaration might still be present, it seems likely that this will not usually
be the case.</para>

<para>Nevertheless, downstream processors may benefit from some indication
of the version of DocBook being used. As a result DocBook V5.0 adds a new
<sgmltag class="attribute">version</sgmltag> attribute which
<glossterm>must</glossterm> be present on the document element of a DocBook
document.</para>

<para>Mixing versions is explicitly allowed and the version attribute
may be used on other elements as well. This might be the case, for
example, in a compound document constructed from multiple documents each
with its own version.</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Co-Constraints</title>

<para>DocBook V5.0 enforces attribute co-constraints such as the
<sgmltag class="attribute">class</sgmltag>/<sgmltag class="attribute">otherclass</sgmltag>
attributes on <sgmltag>biblioid</sgmltag>.</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Improved HTML and CALS Table Support</title>

<para>In DocBook V5.0, HTML tables and CALS tables are independently specified.
Where the DTD of DocBook V4.x allows for incoherent mixing of the two
models, DocBook V5.0 forbids such mixtures.</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Datatypes</title>

<para>DocBook V5.0 adds a few simple data types. For example, the
<sgmltag class="attribute">cols</sgmltag> attribute on <sgmltag>tgroup</sgmltag>
must be a positive integer.</para>

<para>Some of these constraints, such as the requirement that elements
like <sgmltag>pubdate</sgmltag> include a proper date-time type, may
prove controversial. Users are encouraged to report places where formally
valid documents can no longer be made valid because data types have been
introduced.
</para>
</section>

<section id="s.ubiq.link">
<title>Universal Linking</title>

<para>Starting with DocBook V5.0, the
<sgmltag class="attribute">linkend</sgmltag> and
<sgmltag class="attribute">xlink:href</sgmltag> attributes are available on
almost all elements.</para>

<para>The <sgmltag class="attribute">linkend</sgmltag> attribute provides an
ID/IDREF link within the document. The
<sgmltag class="attribute">xlink:href</sgmltag> attribute provides a URI-based
link.</para>

<para>The <sgmltag>ulink</sgmltag> element has been removed from
DocBook as URI-based links can now be achieved directly from
the appropriate inline (such as <sgmltag>productname</sgmltag> or
<sgmltag>command</sgmltag>). For instances where no specific semantic
inline is needed, <sgmltag>link</sgmltag> is still available. Where
<sgmltag>link</sgmltag> used to be limited to ID/IDREF linking, it now
sports an <sgmltag class="attribute">xlink:href</sgmltag> attribute as
well.</para>

<para>Support for
<ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink11/#extended-link">extended links</ulink>
are provided through the
<sgmltag>extendedlink</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>arc</sgmltag>, and
<sgmltag>locator</sgmltag> elements.</para>

</section>

<section id="s.annot">
<title>Improved Accessibility</title>

<para>Accessibility is improved by allowing both inline and block
annotations in most context. The <sgmltag>alt</sgmltag> element is now
allowed in most places for inline annotations, the new element
<sgmltag>annotation</sgmltag> supports block annotations.</para>

</section>

<section id="s.toc">
<title>Simplified Table of Contents Markup</title>

<para>The DocBook V4.x markup for Tables of Contents, or more generally for
Lists of Titles, was complex and had not evolved quite in step with the
rest of DocBook. In DocBook V5.0, it has all been replaced by a quite
simple, recursive
<sgmltag>toc</sgmltag>/<sgmltag>tocdiv</sgmltag>/<sgmltag>tocentry</sgmltag>
structure.</para>

<para>While most Tables of Contents and Lists of Titles are generated
automatically and authors never have to produce markup for them by
hand, this simplified content model should make it easier for authors
to generate when necessary. One possible application of hand-authored
<sgmltag>toc</sgmltag> markup is to generate custom hierarchies which
can be assembled on-the-fly from a library of topics marked up in
DocBook.</para>
</section>

<section id="s.schematron">
<title>Extra-Grammatical Constraints</title>

<para>Grammar based validation technologies (like RELAX NG) and rule based
validation technologies (like Schematron) are naturally complementary. Mixing
them allows us to play to the strengths of each without stretching either
to enforce constraints that they aren’t readily designed to enforce.</para>

<para>For example, DocBook NG requires that the root element of a
document have an explicit version attribute. Because there are a great
many elements that can be root elements in DocBook, and because they
can almost all appear as descendants of a root element as well, it
would be tedious to express this constraint in RELAX NG. But it is
easy in a rule-based schema language.</para>

<para>DocBook V5.0 uses Schematron where appropriate.</para>
</section>

<section id="s.custom">
<title>Customization</title>

<para>From the very beginning, one of the goals of DocBook has been
that users should be able to produce customizations that are either
subsets of extensions of DocBook.</para>

<para>For users familiar with the intricacies of XML DTD syntax and
the rather complex and highly stylized patterns of parameter entity
usage in DocBook, this is possible in DocBook V4.x.</para>

<para>In DocBook V5.0, we hope to take advantage of RELAX NGs more
robust design (and it's lack of pernicious determinism rules) to make
customization easier.</para>

<para>Three schema design patterns get us most of the way there.</para>

<section id="s.patnames">
<title>Logical Groupings</title>

<para>DocBook elements, particularly the inlines, can be divided into
broad classes: general purpose, technical, error-related, operating-system
related, bibliographic, publishing, etc. In DocBook V5.0, these are collected
together in named patterns.</para>

<para>To add a new inline, <literal>endpoint</literal> for example,
to the list of technical inlines, one need only extend the appropriate
pattern. If an element should appear in several classes, they can all
be extended in the same way:</para>

<programlisting>db.technical.inlines |= endpoint
db.programming.inlines |= endpoint
db.os.inlines |= endpoint
</programlisting>

<para>Much the same concept was used in DocBook V4.x, where instead of
patterns we had parameter entities. However, the constraints of DTD
validation severely limit the circumstances under which an element can
appear twice in a content model. That meant that adding an element to
one parameter entity might make it an error to add it to another. Such
constraints do not exist in RELAX NG which greatly simplifies the
customization.</para>
</section>

<section id="s.elemdefs">
<title>Element Definitions</title>

<para>Each element in DocBook V5.0 is defined by its own pattern. To
change the content model of an element, only that pattern need be
redefined. To remove an element from DocBook, that pattern can be
redefined as <quote><literal>notAllowed</literal></quote>.</para>

</section>

<section id="s.attrdefs">
<title>Attribute Definitions</title>

<para>Each attribute list in DocBook V5.0 is defined by its own
pattern. To change the list of attributes available on an element,
only that pattern need be redefined. To remove all the attributes,
that pattern can be redefined as
<quote><literal>empty</literal></quote>.</para>

</section>
</section>

<section>
<title>Conversion</title>

<para>There’s an XSLT 1.0 stylesheet for performing conversion from
DocBook V4.x to DocBook V5.0. Presented with a valid DocBook V4.x document,
it attempts to produce a valid DocBook V5.0 document.</para>

<para>It succeeds entirely automatically for the most part, though human
intervention is suggested for constructs that might have multiple
interpretations (and therefore multiple possible transformations).</para>

<para>Users are encouraged to report documents that are not
successfully transformed by the stylesheet, especially those which do
have valid DocBook V5.0 representations.
