<section id="s.intro">
<title>Introduction</title>

<para>DocBook is general purpose document type particularly well
suited to books and papers about computer hardware and software
(though it is by no means limited to these applications).
</para>

<para>Simplified DocBook is an attempt to provide a proper subset of
DocBook that is simultaneously smaller and still useful. Its original
genesis was a desire to make <quote>the HTML subset of
DocBook,</quote> that is, a subset that had roughly as many tags as
HTML and roughly the same descriptive power.</para>

<para>The <ulink url="mailto:docbook-tc@oasis-open.org">DocBook
Technical Committee</ulink> maintains the Simplified DocBook schema.
Simplified DocBook is officially available as an <xref linkend="xml-rec"/> Document Type
Definition (DTD).</para>

<para>The Version 1.0 release is the first official release from the DocBook
Technical Committee.</para>

<para>The DocBook Technical Committee welcomes bug reports and
requests for enhancement (RFEs) from the user community. The current list
of outstanding requests is available through the
<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</ulink>
<ulink url="&tracker;/?atid=384107&amp;group_id=21935&amp;func=browse">tracker</ulink>
interface. This is also the preferred mechanism for submitting new requests.
Old RFEs, from a previous legacy tracking system, are
<ulink url="https://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/old-rfes.html">archived</ulink>
for reference.</para>

<title>Changes in Simplified DocBook V1.0CR3</title>

<para>This release updates Simplified DocBook to be a customization of DocBook XML V4.2.
All of the changes in this release are a consequence of the transition to
DocBook XML V4.2; no substantive changes have been made to Simplified DocBook
directly.

<para>Each of the changes made between V1.0CR2 and V1.0CR3
is summarized here.</para>

<note>
<para>In most cases, where DocBook XML V4.2 allows new elements (for example
<sgmltag>personname</sgmltag> and <sgmltag>co</sgmltag>),
Simplified DocBook still uses the former, more restrictive content models.
