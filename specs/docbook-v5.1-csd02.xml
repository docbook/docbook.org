<title>Background</title>

<para>DocBook is general purpose
<xref linkend="xml-rec"/>
schema particularly well suited to books and papers about computer
hardware and software (though it is by no means limited to these
applications).
</para>

<para>The <link xlink:href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/docbook/">DocBook
Technical Committee</link> maintains the DocBook schema. Starting
with V5.0, DocBook is normatively available as a
<biblioref linkend="iso19757-2"/> Schema (with some additional
<biblioref linkend="iso19757-3"/> assertions).
A non-normative <biblioref linkend="xmlschema-1"/> version will
be published when it is available.
DocBook builds on existing XML technologies: it uses
<biblioref linkend="xlink11"/> for linking,
<biblioref linkend="xmlschema-2"/> for atomic data types, and
anticipates the use of
<biblioref linkend="xinclude"/> for transclusion.</para>

<note>
<para>DocBook has been
under active maintenance for more than 20 years, it began life as
an <biblioref linkend="iso8879"/> document type definition.</para>
</note>

<para>The Version 5.1 introduces assemblies for topic-oriented authoring
and addresses a selection of bugs and feature requests.</para>

<para>The DocBook Technical Committee welcomes bug reports and
requests for enhancement (RFEs) from the user community.
Please send comments and requests for enhancement to the
DocBook comments list,
<link xlink:href="mailto:docbook-comment@lists.oasis-open.org">docbook-comment@lists.oasis-open.org</link> mailing list.
Outstanding requests can be seen in the archives as well as
in the

interface.

<title>Distribution</title>

<para>The DocBook RELAX NG Schema (and associated non-normative schemas
and tools) are distributed with this specification.
DocBook is also available from the mirror on

</para>

<para>This prose specification is one component of a Work Product
that also includes:</para>

<?artifact-list?>

</section>
</section><section xml:id="s.identifying">
<title>Identifying DocBook Documents and Schemas</title>

<para>For systems that can make use of public identifiers, e.g., systems
where the informative DTD is being used, the following
public identifier <glossterm>should</glossterm> be used for DocBook V5.1:
“<literal>-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V5.1//EN//XML</literal>”.</para>

<note>
<para>Historically, when DocBook was defined by a DTD, DocBook
documents could be identified by the presence of standard public
and/or system identifiers in the document type declaration. RELAX NG,
the normative schema language for DocBook V5.0, does not provide
any equivalent mechanism.</para>
</note>

</section><section xml:id="s.conformance">
<title>Conformance</title>

<para>This specification normatively defines DocBook V5.1 with a RELAX NG
grammar and a set of Schematron assertions. A conformant DocBook V5.1 document
<glossterm>must</glossterm> be valid according to both the grammar and the
assertions.</para>

<para>DocBook documents are described by a set of schemas:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>“Plain” DocBook documents and DocBook Assembly documents. The schema
for assembly documents is separate as a convenience for authors, it is
conceptually part of the whole set of DocBook documents.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>DocBook + International Tag Set (ITS) Version 2.0; this schema allows
authors to write valid DocBook documents that satisfy
ITS Conformance Type 1 as defined in <biblioref linkend="its20"/>.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>DocBook + XInclude markup; this schema is not normative. It allows
authors to write documents which mix DocBook markup and XInclude in many
(but perhaps not all) reasonable places.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The schemas in question are:</para>

<?schemas-list?>

<para>The reference documentation (see <biblioref linkend="bib.docbooktdg51"/>) describes general processing
expectations for each element and some of the circumstances in which
they may or may not apply. Understanding and conforming to these
processing expectations where practical is likely to improve
interoperability.</para>

<note>
<para><biblioref linkend="bib.docbooktdg5"/>, the reference
documentation for DocBook V5.0, much of which still applies to DocBook
V5.1, is also available in published form from

<title>Changes in DocBook V5.1</title>

<para>DocBook V5.1 fixes a number of bugs, summarized below, and adds
a significant new feature designed for the purpose of topic-based
authoring: assemblies.</para>

<section xml:id="s.assembly">
<title>Assemblies</title>

<para>One modern school of thought on technical documentation stresses
the development of independent units of documentation, often called
topics, rather than a single narrative. Instead of writing something
that DocBook users would easily recognize as a book consisting of a
preface, several consecutive chapters, and a few appendixes, the
author (or authors) write a set of discrete topics covering different aspects of
the system as if they were wholly independent.</para>

<para>In a typical online presentation system, for example the world
wide web or online help, each topic is a page that stands alone.
Except, of course, that just as no man is an island, no topic is
completely unrelated to the other topics that are available.</para>

<para>From any given topic, there may be topics of obviously related
interest. The nature of the relationships may vary. Some topics are
related by physical proximity (if you're interested in the ink
cartridges in a printer, you may also be interested in the print
head), others by their procedural nature (adding or replacing memory,
adding or replacing a hard drive, or even changing the CPU are all
topics that might logically follow a topic that describes how to open
the computer case).</para>

<para>In a single narrative, it is the responsibility of the author to
manage these relationships. He or she can reasonably assume that
anyone reading chapter 4 has read chapters 1, 2, and 3. If the reader
needs to be directed elsewhere, a cross reference can be used (for
example, “for more information on paper jams, see Section 3.5,
<citetitle>The Paper Path</citetitle>”).</para>

<para>In a topic-oriented system, authors are explicitly instructed to
write independent units. No linear order can be assumed and many forms
of explicit cross-reference are discouraged.</para>

<para>Documentation managers treat the library of available topics
very much as programmers treat libraries of available functions. Just
as any given program can pick and choose from the available libraries,
the documentation for any given system can pick and choose from the
available topics.</para>

<para>If you imagine a large documentation group managing the documentation
for several related systems (different models of printer, different
configurations of a software system, computers assembled from
different components, etc.) it's easy to see the appeal of topic-oriented
authoring.</para>

<para>In a successful deployment, you might find a library of say 1,000
topics which, taken together, document five or six related systems, each of
which uses 700-800 topics. Some topics are used in every system, many are
used in several systems, and a small number of topics are unique to a
specific system.</para>

<para>In order to make such a documentation platform functional, you
need not only the individual topics, but also some sort of “map” or
“assembly” file that describes which topics from the library are used,
what relationships exist between them and, at least for print
presentation, what linear order is to be imposed upon them.</para>

<para>DocBook uses assemblies for this purpose, see
