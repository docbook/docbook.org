         <h1>What is DocBook?</h1>
         <p>DocBook is a schema (available in several languages including
            RELAX NG, SGML and XML DTDs, and W3C XML Schema)
            maintained by the
            <a href="mailto:docbook-tc@oasis-open.org">DocBook Technical
               Committee</a>
            of <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</a>.
            It is particularly well suited to books and papers about computer
            hardware and software (though it is by no means limited to these applications).
            
         </p>
         <p>
            Because it is a large and robust schema, and because its main
            structures correspond to the general notion of what constitutes
            a “book,” DocBook has been adopted by a large and
            growing community of authors writing books of all kinds. DocBook
            is supported “out of the box” by a number of
            commercial tools, and there is rapidly expanding support for it
            in a number of free software environments. These features have
            combined to make DocBook a generally easy to understand, widely
            useful, and very popular schema. Dozens of organizations are using
            DocBook for millions of pages of documentation, in various print
            and online formats, worldwide.

            <p>
               The DocBook Technical Committee maintains both SGML and XML
               versions
               of the DocBook DTD and XML versions in several other languages.
               To the extent that it is practical, these DTDs
               are identical. There is no intentional difference between the DTDs, they
               are supposed to accept the same set of documents.

                  <h3>The HaL and O'Reilly Era</h3>
               </div>
               <p>The DocBook DTD was originally designed and implemented by HaL Computer
                  Systems and O'Reilly &amp; Associates around 1991. It was developed primarily
                  for the purpose of holding the results of <code class="literal">troff</code> conversion
                  of UNIX documentation, so that the files could be interchanged. Its design
                  appears to have been based partly on input from SGML interchange projects
                  being conducted by the UNIX International and Open Software Foundation consortia.
               </p>
               <p>When DocBook V1.1 was published, its revision and maintenance began
                  being discussed in earnest in the Davenport Group, a forum created by O'Reilly
                  for computer documentation producers. V1.2 was influenced strongly by Novell
                  and Digital.
               </p>
               <p>In 1994, the Davenport Group became an officially chartered entity responsible
                  for DocBook's maintenance; DocBook V1.2.2 was published simultaneously. The
                  founding sponsors of this incarnation of Davenport included the following:

                  <h3>The Davenport Era</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Under the auspices of the Davenport Group, the DocBook DTD began to
                  take on a larger scope: It was now being used by a much wider audience, and
                  for new purposes, such as direct authoring with SGML-aware tools and publishing
                  directly to paper. As the largest users of DocBook, Novell and Sun tended
                  to have heavy influence on the design.
               </p>
               <p>In order to help users manage change, the new Davenport charter established
                  the following rules for DocBook releases:
               </p>
               <div class="itemizedlist">
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        <p>Minor versions (“<span class="quote">point releases,</span>” such as V2.2)
                           could add to the markup model, but could not change it in a backwards-incompatible
                           way. For example, a new kind of list element could be added, but it would
                           not be acceptable for the existing itemized-list model to start requiring
                           two list items inside it instead of only one. Thus, any document conforming
                           to version <em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em>.0 would also conform to <em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em>.<em class="replaceable"><code>m</code></em>.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Major versions (such as V3.0) could both add to the markup
                           model and make backwards-incompatible changes. However, the changes had to
                           have been announced in the <em>previous</em> major release.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Major-version introductions must be separated by at least
                           a year.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </div>
               <p>V3.0 was released in January 1997. After that time, although DocBook's
                  audience continued to grow, many of the stalwarts of the Davenport Group became
                  involved in the XML effort, and development slowed dramatically. The idea
                  of creating an official XML-compliant version of DocBook was discussed, but
                  not implemented.
               </p>
               <p>The sponsors wanted to close out Davenport in an orderly way, but ensure
                  that DocBook users would be supported somehow. It was suggested that OASIS
                  become DocBook's new home. An OASIS DocBook Technical Committee was formed
                  in July, 1998, with Eduardo Gutentag of Sun as chair.
