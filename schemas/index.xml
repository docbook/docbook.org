<para>DocBook is a schema (available in several languages including
RELAX NG, W3C XML Schemas, and XML DTDs)
maintained by the
<link xlink:href="mailto:docbook-tc@oasis-open.org">DocBook Technical
Committee</link> of <link
xlink:href="http://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</link>. It is particularly
well suited to books and papers about computer hardware and software
(though it is by no means limited to these applications).
</para>
<para>Historically, DocBook was a DTD. Some older versions are only
available in that format.</para>
