<title>DocBook V5.<replaceable>x</replaceable></title>
</info>

<para>The version 5.0 release is a complete rewrite of DocBook in
RELAX NG. The intent of this rewrite is to produce a schema that is
true to the spirit of DocBook while simultaneously removing
inconsistencies that have arisen as a natural consequence of DocBook's
long, slow evolution. The Technical Committee has taken this
opportunity to simplify a number of content models and tighten
constraints where RELAX NG makes that possible.
</para>

<para>The Technical Committee provides the DocBook 5.0 and 5.1 schemas in other
schema languages, including W3C XML Schema and an
XML DTD, but the RELAX NG Schema is the normative schema.</para>

<title>DocBook V5.x XML Schema</title>

<para>The XML Schema version of DocBook V5.x is now maintained
separately; it is no longer mechanically generated from the RELAX NG
version.</para>

<para>This is an attempt to craft an XML Schema versions of DocBook
V5.0 that is reasonably useful. It's impossible
to accurately capture all of the grammatical constraints of DocBook in
XML Schema, but these versions (should) accept all valid documents.
They may also accept some invalid ones; always use the normative RELAX
NG grammars to be sure.</para>
<para>These initial releases are experimental, they have no normative
standing.</para>
